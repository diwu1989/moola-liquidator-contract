# moola-liquidator-contract

Based on work from https://github.com/dkirsche/aave-liquidator adapted to Moola and Ubeswap

TODO:
- switch from using ubeswap to using mento for fee-less swaps
- figure out how to test this out

Feel free to send Celo/Moo donations to 0x5Ca621B88f8f3919eb4B9324CC780a3DF34f95fD
